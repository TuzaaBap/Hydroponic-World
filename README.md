# Hydroponic World 🌱

Hydroponic World is an IoT-based hydroponics monitoring and automation system developed for the VIOS Hackathon.

## What it does
- Live monitoring of key parameters (pH, TDS, temperature, humidity, etc.)
- Automation using relay-based control (e.g., pumps/valves)
- Real-time dashboard view (web-based)

## Tech Stack
- Raspberry Pi / ESP32
- MQTT (optional)
- Python + Flask (or your stack)
- Sensors: pH, TDS, DHTxx, CO₂, etc.

## Project Goal
Build a reliable, low-cost hydroponic system with real-time visibility and basic automation for stable plant growth.

## Team
Built for VIOS Hackathon.
